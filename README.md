## ‚úÖ Elements I Did Well

### 1. **Chart and Calculations Table**

* I successfully implemented a dynamic chart and a calculations table, which was a core part of the challenge.
* It required me to handle data efficiently and ensure that the calculations and visualizations were accurate.
* This demonstrates my proficiency in working with  **React, Redux, and Chart libraries** , along with data transformation and representation.

### 2. **Redux Slices with Test Cases**

* I created well-structured **Redux slices** to manage application state and keep the code clean and scalable.
* Additionally, I wrote **test cases** to validate the functionality of the slices, ensuring that the calculations are accurate and the state management works as expected.
* This highlights my ability to  **write testable and maintainable code** .

## ‚è© Improvements if I Had 4 More Hours

1. **Backend for Excel File Handling (Python Flask + Pandas)**
   * I would create a backend service using **Flask + Pandas** to handle Excel file uploads and process the data in the backend.
   * This would reduce the **load on the frontend** and allow for processing large datasets efficiently.
   * This would also enable advanced processing and custom calculations in the backend.
2. **Pagination for Data**
   * I would implement **pagination** in the table to reduce the rendering load for large datasets.
   * This would significantly improve the application's performance and enhance user experience.
3. **Additional Chart Customizations**
   * I would add more customizable options in the chart (like selecting date ranges, comparison charts, etc.).
   * This would give users more control over data visualization, making the tool more powerful.
4. **Responsive UI Improvements**
   * I would fine-tune the **responsive design** to make the charts and tables look better on mobile and tablet devices.
   * This ensures a smooth experience across all devices.

## üí° Feedback on the Challenge

* The challenge was interesting and practical. However, it would be helpful if the challenge provided **detailed documentation** or clear expectations about the outcome.
* I found it a bit difficult to understand what exactly you wanted to implement, so more clarity in the problem statement would improve the experience.
* Overall, it was a great opportunity to showcase my skills in  **React, Redux, and data visualization** .
